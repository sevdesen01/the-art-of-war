        <p>WHEN ONE TREATS PEOPLE WITH BENEVOLENCE, JUSTICE, AND RIGHTEOUSNESS, AND REPOSES CONFIDENCE IN THEM, THE ARMY WILL BE UNITED IN MIND AND ALL WILL BE HAPPY TO SERVE THEIR LEADERS.” ―SUN TZU</p>

      <h5> WHO IS GENERAL SUN TZU?</h5>
      <h1>THE GREATEST MILITARY STRATEGIST</h1>
      <p>The oldest available sources disagree as to where Sun Tzu was born. The Spring and Autumn Annals and Sima Qian's later Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji) state that Sun Tzu was born in Qi. Both sources also agree that Sun Tzu was born in the late Spring and Autumn period and that he was active as a general and strategist, serving King Helü of Wu in the late sixth century BC, beginning around 512 BC. Sun Tzu's victories then inspired him to write The Art of War. The Art of War was one of the most widely read military treatises in the subsequent Warring States period, a time of constant war among seven ancient Chinese states–Zhao, Qi, Qin, Chu, Han, Wei, and Yan–who fought to control the vast expanse of fertile territory in <span>Eastern China.</span></p>
